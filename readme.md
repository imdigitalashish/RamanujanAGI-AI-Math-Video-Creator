If you are facing issues such as pycairo not getting installed on Mac

do

`brew install cairo`
and 

`brew install pkg-config`

as cairo uses pkg-config for doing some secret shit

and also you need to install

`brew install ffmpeg`

because it uses to process the video

and Yes it's required the freaking latex so you need to install

`brew install mactex`

so to support latex

NOTE: THESE ARE THE ONLY ERRORS I FOUND IF YOU FOUND ANY OTHER GOODDD LUCKKK WITH THATTT !!!
